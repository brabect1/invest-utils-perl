TODO List
---------

* introduce unit tests

* add support for direct asset transfers (deposits, withdrawals) in portfolio performance

* add support for accounts within the portfolio
  (so that balances of individual accounts can be queried separately; this is
  to help checking annual acount balance reports against the DB; it may also help
  evaluating performance of individual accounts)
